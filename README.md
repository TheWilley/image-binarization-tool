# Image Binarization Tool

This is a tool for generating binary images using the various thresholding algorithms available in [ImageJS](https://docs.image-js.org/docs/features/operations/threshold).

## How to use

Simply go to the [official webpage](https://thewilley.github.io/image-binarization-tool/) to get
started, or run the app yourself by following these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/TheWilley/image-binarization-tool.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd image-binarization-tool

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Build app
$ npm run build

# If you want to start the app
$ npm run preview

# If you want to develop the app
$ npm run dev
```

## About RLE Encoded Data

Seeing as a binary image is built with exactly two values, RLE encoding is rather efficient as large white / black sections (runs) are common. Of course, the less variation the better the compression ratio. This means we can store images in just a couple of KB.

The decoder parses strings using a custom syntax to extract parameters and render a image:

```
Image Width | Image Height | Below Threshold Color | Above Threshold Color | Start Color + Runs (Comma Separated)
```

**Image Width** and **Image Height** is obvious enough, but what about **Below Threshold Color**, **Above Threshold Color**, **Start Color** and **Runs**? Runs in the context of RLE are the number of consecutive occurrences of the same data value represented as a single occurrence of that data value and a count of its consecutive occurrences ([as described by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)). I've slightly modified optimized it, removing the need to define the data value for each run by defining the start color (0 = color below threshold, 1 = color above threshold - Typically these are black and white) in the very first entry of the runs sequence. Because we only have two values, if we know the color of the very first pixel (start color), we know what color comes after it, and so we simply alternate between them during the encoding / decoding process.

Below is a non-truncated example string which renders the outline of a cat. Try inserting it into the [decoder](https://thewilley.github.io/image-binarization-tool/?tab=decode) and see the results!
